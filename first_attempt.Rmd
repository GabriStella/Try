## graphics

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
views <- data.frame(season = 1:9,
                    viewers= c(9.47, 8.94, 8.21, 9.42, 8.60, 8.79, 9.67, 9.02, 10.51 ))
ggplot(views, aes(x=as.factor(season), y = viewers)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge",
           fill= "goldenrod3") +
  geom_text(aes(label= viewers),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  labs(x="season",
       y="viewers (mln)",
       title= "viewers of each HIMYM's season")

```

```{r}
variations <- data.frame(season = 1:9,
                    changes= c(0, -0.056, -0.082, 0.148, -0.087, 0.022, 0.1, -0.067, 0.165) )
ggplot(variations, aes(x = season, y = changes)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

# i can't understand why in the x label it shows me just 2.5 , 5 and 7.5 !
```

### conclusion

as we can see there are no evidence of a trend during the time.

anyway we can note that:

-   the season with more viewers `r max(views$viewers)`
